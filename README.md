This repository is for the project assessment of the project of the 4th module of : solidity-avax-intermediate course of Metacrafters academy . The purpose of creating this to prove my learning and to showcase my skill as a solidity developer to the people.

# Problem Statement
## Description
Are you up for a challenge that will put your skills to the test? Degen Gaming üéÆ, a renowned game studio, has approached you to create a unique token that can reward players and take their game to the next level.

Solution Description
This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has different functions that connnects our metacrafter wallet which is set on Avalnche fuji C-Chain testnet and can see all the transaction at: https://testnet.snowtrace.io and contract is deployed using Remix IDE: https://remix.ethereum.org/ with this smart contract all the above given are geing performed.

It's essential to connect the metamask wallet with Avalanche Fuji C-Chain Testnet and to add view transaction to: https://testnet.snowtrace.io to check the transaction on the block viewer of Avalance Platform.

## Getting Started
## Executing Program
Open Remix IDE and create the Smart Contract named " DegenToken.sol " and paste the smart contract code to it.
Connect Metamask to the Remix IDE with the testnet account having AVAX token for the gas fee.
Deploy the contract using " Avalanche Fuji C-Chain " account.
Copy the Deployed contract address and go to https://testnet.snowtrace.io
Search the coppied address in the search box it will show all the transaction blocks of that smart contract.
Check All the functionality of my smart contract.
